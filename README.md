Project Description: Blogging Application Backend API

Overview:
The Blogging Application Backend API is a sophisticated and secure platform developed to empower users in expressing their thoughts and engaging with a community of bloggers. 
This backend API provides essential functionalities such as user registration, login, blog creation, viewing others' blogs, and commenting. 
The project is built using cutting-edge technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA, Hibernate, and incorporates a robust JWT 
authentication system to ensure the security and integrity of user data.

Key Features:
-> User Authentication and Registration:
->Seamless user registration process to onboard new users.
->Secure login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for enhanced protection against unauthorized access.

Blog Management:
-> Intuitive API endpoints for creating and publishing blogs.
-> Efficient integration of Java and Spring Boot to handle backend processes seamlessly.
-> MySQL database integration for persistent storage of blog data.


Content Interaction:
-> API endpoints to enable users to view blogs created by others.
-> Commenting functionality allowing users to engage in discussions and share insights on blog posts.

Technological Stack:
-> Java: Utilized for its versatility and platform independence.
-> Spring Boot: Accelerates development with pre-built templates, reducing boilerplate code.
-> MySQL: A robust relational database management system for structured data storage.
-> JPA (Java Persistence API): Streamlines database operations, enhancing data access in Java applications.
-> Hibernate: An ORM framework that simplifies database interactions, promoting code maintainability.


Security Measures:
-> JWT Authentication: Ensures secure and reliable user authentication, protecting against common security threats.
-> Hibernate and JPA: Safeguards against SQL injection and other database-related vulnerabilities.
